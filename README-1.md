SEO and Cleaning up the code
The brief was to clean up the code using semantic CSS. To do so I did the following; - removed 'div' containers and inserted a 'nav' element and section elements - This makes the code more readable for SEO
I also included 'Alt' descriptions after each image so that this is also readible for SEO purposes. I included keywords for this purpose but I could have described the image in more detail to help those with impairments.
To improve further separate pages could be created by service, rather than putting all services on the same page. As search engines prefer 'clean websites' which have a clear directory and map. Each title could show the key services offered.
For SEO purposes the image Alt tags should also match key words whoch they do here.
The CSS file was altered in-line with the HTML code
I have added border box so the border and padding will be accounted for in relation to the elements, as user interfaces change.
